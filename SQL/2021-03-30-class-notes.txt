some notes from today's class

DISTINCT = R unique()
WHERE = R dplyr::filter()
  - this is very similar

LIKE and wildcards - % and GLOB

making summaries on the fly:

  - AVG and GROUP BY

change name of variable (mutate or rename) with AS

- when running a SELECT query remember the result is a temporary thing; as soon
as you make another query it will be gone

- the .mode list turns on delimiter setting; then set separator with .separator.
Finally call .output FILENAME

sqlite3 is sloppy about capitalization; the standard SQL query commands will still work
even if they are not capitalized. Something to be aware of.

Keep the order straight: WHERE goes before GROUP BY but before HAVING

# Joining

- only 2 types of joins can be done by sqlite3 - inner joins and left joins
